## About the Project ü§ì

"AntiRecurso" initially began as an Android mobile app designed to help ISEP students studying for exams. Over time, it has evolved into a platform that caters to a broad range of academic subjects, accessible from any device.

Whether using a computer, tablet, or mobile phone, AntiRecurso provides numerous exercises in the form of short quizzes, each with 10 random questions. Upon completion, users receive immediate feedback and their performance is tracked on a scoreboard.

## The Tech Stack üîß

For this project, we're using the Next.js framework.

Here's a quick rundown of the tech stack:

- **Next.js**: An open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that uses class utilities to build any design, directly in the markup.

- **Framer Motion**: A motion library for React that helps create smooth and delightful animations. It provides a simple and intuitive API to animate components and create interactive user experiences.

## Roadmap or Future Plans üöÄ

We have an exciting vision for the future of AntiRecurso! Here are some of the planned features and enhancements we have in store:

- **Enhanced Question Bank**: Expand the question bank across multiple subjects. We aim to provide a comprehensive set of questions that cover a wide range of topics to cater to the needs of students studying various disciplines.

- **Social Features**: Implement social features to foster a community of learners. This may include the ability to connect with other users, share achievements, and engage in discussions related to specific subjects or questions.

- **Localization and Multilingual Support**: Provide localization options and multilingual support to make AntiRecurso accessible to a wider audience. This will involve translating the user interface and quizzes.

- **Gamification Elements**: Introduce gamification elements, such as badges, rewards, to make the learning process more engaging and motivating for users. This will encourage healthy competition and provide incentives for users to actively participate and improve their performance.

- **Accessibility Improvements**: Continuously work on improving the accessibility of the platform to ensure that it is usable by individuals with diverse abilities. This includes adhering to accessibility guidelines, optimizing the user interface for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Note that these are just a few examples of the features and enhancements we have planned for AntiRecurso. The roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, community contributions, and emerging needs in the education sector.

We invite you to join us on this journey of growth and innovation as we strive to create a powerful and accessible learning platform for the students. If you have any suggestions or ideas for future development, we'd love to hear from you!

Let's make learning fun and effective together! üåü
